**Feature Branch**: `002-deploy-the-static`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Deploy the static website to github pages via an action"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
 - üîí Respect Constitution Principle 2 (Zero External Runtime Dependencies): Do not introduce requirements that imply adding external CDNs, frameworks, or third-party scripts without explicit governance amendment.

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a maintainer, I want every merge (or tagged release) on the main branch to automatically publish the generated static Hugo site to a public GitHub Pages endpoint so that updated content becomes available without manual file copying.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a successful merge to `main`, **When** the automated publish workflow runs, **Then** the latest commit's static output is available at the configured GitHub Pages URL within a short interval (‚â§ 5 minutes) and reflects all public (non-draft, non-future) content.
2. **Given** the build fails due to invalid content metadata (e.g., missing required front matter), **When** the workflow executes, **Then** no new deployment is published and the workflow logs clearly indicate the validation failure.
3. **Given** a future-dated post, **When** the site is deployed before its date, **Then** the post is not listed on index pages nor in feeds but its page (if directly navigated) contains the scheduled indicators per existing feature spec.
4. **Given** deterministic build expectations, **When** two consecutive builds of the same commit run in the workflow, **Then** their outputs (excluding timestamp lines) are identical, otherwise the deployment step is blocked.
5. **Given** a manually triggered workflow dispatch (rebuild), **When** no site content changed, **Then** the deployment either reuses a cached build or publishes identical assets without spurious changes.

### Edge Cases
- Build executed on a fork PR: deployment must be skipped to avoid unauthorized publishing.
- Invalid Hugo version pinned locally vs workflow environment: workflow must fail early with explicit message.
- Large media additions: deployment should still succeed; optimization is out of scope but deployment must not timeout.
- Draft content accidentally committed: drafts must not appear in published output.
- Custom domain: CNAME must exist in published root every deployment; failure to inject correct CNAME file blocks publish.
- Deployment concurrency: if two merges happen rapidly, only the latest should represent the final deployed state (previous still accessible until replaced).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The platform MUST automatically build the static site from the `main` branch without manual intervention after each merge (or tagged release if later restricted).
- **FR-002**: The build step MUST use the pinned Hugo (extended) version declared in project documentation; mismatch MUST cause failure.
- **FR-003**: The deployment MUST exclude draft and future-dated content from indexes and feeds while still generating scheduled post pages with `noindex` metadata.
- **FR-004**: A deterministic double-build (same commit) MUST produce bitwise-identical output (excluding known timestamp lines) before publishing; divergence blocks publish.
- **FR-005**: The deployment MUST publish artifacts to GitHub Pages (Pages branch / storage) such that the public URL updates within ‚â§5 minutes.
- **FR-006**: The workflow MUST surface validation failures (front matter, alt text, deterministic diff) with clear log messages.
- **FR-007**: The deployment MUST NOT introduce external runtime dependencies (no added CDN references) as part of artifact generation.
- **FR-008**: Deployment MUST skip on pull requests originating from forks (safety) and only run fully on `main` (or a manual dispatch event).
- **FR-009**: A manual re-run capability MUST exist (workflow_dispatch) to rebuild without code changes.
- **FR-010**: The process MUST ensure a `CNAME` file with the configured custom domain is present in the published root on every deployment.
- **FR-011**: Logs MUST include final published commit SHA and site URL for traceability.
- **FR-012**: Deployment MUST maintain previous version availability until new assets are fully written (no partially broken state).
- **FR-013**: Workflow MUST fail fast (under 2 minutes) on invalid configuration (missing Hugo version or tool install failure).
- **FR-014**: Workflow MUST allow future extension to support release-only deployments without rewriting core logic.
- **FR-015**: (Stretch) Provide a summary artifact (e.g., text file) listing newly added/modified posts in the deployment for changelog usage.

*Unresolved / Clarification Needed:*
*(None ‚Äì all critical clarifications in scope resolved for this feature.)*

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **DeploymentRun**: Metadata describing a publish attempt (commit SHA, start time, end time, success flag, published URL reference, validation summary).
- **SiteArtifact**: The built static output directory; attributes: size, file count, hash manifest (optional future enhancement), excluded items list.

## Review & Acceptance Checklist
*GATE: Automated checks run during main() execution*

### Content Quality

- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs (automated publishing, reliability, integrity)
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (pending C1‚ÄìC3 resolution)
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous (except marked clarifications)
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable (deployment timing, deterministic diff, exclusion rules)
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded (publish pipeline only; no media optimization changes)
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified (GitHub Pages availability, pinned Hugo version)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: How should deployments be triggered? (every push vs tags vs hybrid vs manual) ‚Üí A: Every push to main
- Q: Will a custom domain (CNAME) be used now? ‚Üí A: Yes, custom domain immediately (CNAME in repo)
- Q: How should historical deployment artifacts be handled? ‚Üí A: Keep only latest (overwrite)

### Applied Updates
- Updated **FR-001** to explicitly require deployment on every push to `main` (removed optional tagged release wording).
- Removed FR-C1 from unresolved list (resolved by clarification).
- Updated **FR-010** to require CNAME file each deployment; removed FR-C2 from unresolved list.
- Added **FR-016** defining retention policy (latest only, atomic overwrite) and removed FR-C3 from unresolved list.
