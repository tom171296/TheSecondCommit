# Feature Specification: Blog Post Page & Markdown Content Pipeline

**Feature Branch**: `001-blog-post-page`  
**Created**: 2025-09-25  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want a blog post page that converts markdown into blog posts. Do a proposal for a design. The name of the site is TheSecondCommit. It is a podcast and blog site. I just want to focus on the blog part first."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers
 - üîí Respect Constitution Principle 2 (Zero External Runtime Dependencies): Do not introduce requirements that imply adding external CDNs, frameworks, or third-party scripts without explicit governance amendment.

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content editor I can add a new Markdown file with required front matter so that it automatically
appears as a properly formatted blog post page on TheSecondCommit when the site is built.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid Markdown file with front matter (title, date, description, slug), **When** the build runs, **Then** the post appears at `/blog/<slug>/` with rendered HTML, metadata tags, internal navigation, and passes accessibility & performance budgets.
2. **Given** a Markdown file missing a required field (e.g., title), **When** the build script validates content, **Then** it fails with a clear error listing the missing field.
3. **Given** a post marked `draft: true`, **When** the production build runs, **Then** the draft is excluded from the output.
4. **Given** a post containing code fences, **When** rendered, **Then** code blocks are semantically marked (`<pre><code>`) without external highlight JS/CSS and remain readable in both light and dark contrast contexts.
5. **Given** pagination requirements (more than X posts on listing page), **When** viewing page 2, **Then** canonical and pagination navigation tags are present.

### Edge Cases
- Future-dated post: Accessible directly (URL known) but NOT listed until `date <= build date`; page shows "Scheduled" badge + `noindex` until publish date.
- Extremely long word/URL: Must wrap without horizontal scroll.
- Missing description: Build fails listing file(s) lacking `description`.
- Duplicate slug detection: Build fails if two posts share slug.
- Embedded media (images, audio link) missing file: Build should warn or fail? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Policy on missing assets]
- RSS feed size limit: Only 50 newest posts included; older still accessible via HTML archives.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST convert every Markdown file in `content/blog/` with required front matter into an HTML page at `/blog/<slug>/`.
- **FR-002**: System MUST enforce required front matter fields: `title`, `date`, `description`, `slug`, `draft` (boolean), and MUST fail build with clear error if any are missing (unless `draft` defaults to false).
- **FR-003**: System MUST exclude posts where `draft: true` OR (future date AND scheduling not enabled) from production build.
// Clarified by Clarifications Session 2025-09-25: scheduling enabled, behavior adjusted below.
- **FR-003**: System MUST treat future-dated posts as "Scheduled":
   - Generate the post page at `/blog/<slug>/` with a visible "Scheduled" badge
   - Add `<meta name="robots" content="noindex">` while date is in the future
   - Exclude from blog index pagination and RSS (if RSS in scope)
   - Automatically include in index and remove badge + `noindex` once build date >= post date.
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate SEO meta tags (title, description, og:title, og:description, og:type=article, article:published_time) per post using front matter.
- **FR-005**: System MUST create an accessible article layout: semantic landmarks (main, header, nav), heading hierarchy starting with a single H1 (post title).
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide internal navigation: link back to blog index and optional previous/next post links ordered by date descending.
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate slug uniqueness across all blog posts; duplicate slug detection MUST cause build failure.
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate a blog index page `/blog/` showing paginated list (default page size 10) with title, publish date, short description/excerpt.
- **FR-009**: System MUST create page-level breadcrumb or skip link enabling keyboard users to bypass navigation.
- **FR-010**: System MUST render code blocks without external libraries (no CDN highlight) and maintain WCAG AA contrast.
 - **FR-011**: System MUST fail the build if any Markdown image lacks an alt text. Decorative images MUST use an explicit empty alt (`![](...)`) indicating intentional emptiness; absence is treated as an error with a list of offending file paths.
- **FR-012**: System MUST add canonical URL tag `<link rel="canonical">` for each post.
- **FR-013**: System MUST generate an RSS 2.0 feed at `/blog/index.xml` containing only published (non-draft, non-future) posts, ordered newest first, limited to 50 entries; each item includes title, link, guid (slug-based), pubDate (RFC 1123), description (front matter), and `<atom:updated>` if `lastmod` present.
- **FR-014**: System MUST keep total critical payload for a post page ‚â§ 250KB excluding images/audio.
- **FR-015**: System MUST pass accessibility automated baseline (0 serious aXe violations) during CI.
- **FR-016**: System MUST produce deterministic output given identical inputs and pinned Hugo version.
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide a mechanism to mark a post as updated (e.g., optional `lastmod` field) and surface this in metadata.
- **FR-018**: System MUST ensure future extension to podcast episode layout does not require rework of blog templates (separation of concerns in partials). [Non-technical phrasing: design prepared for later podcast expansion.]
// New requirement derived from scheduling clarification.
- **FR-019**: System MUST expose a deterministic flag (e.g., in template context) indicating scheduled status to allow conditional UI (badge + exclusion logic) without code duplication.

*Ambiguity Markers / Clarifications Needed:*

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Blog Post**: Represents a single article. Attributes: title (string), date (ISO date), description (string), slug (string), body (Markdown content), tags (list, optional), draft (bool), lastmod (optional date), audio (future expansion, ignored now). Relationships: None in this scope beyond ordering/pagination.
- **Blog Index Page**: Derived aggregation of Blog Post entities with pagination metadata (page number, total pages, items per page).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

### Session 2025-09-25
- Q: How should the system treat future-dated blog posts? ‚Üí A: Include page, badge, noindex, hide from index until date
